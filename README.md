# PROJECT_2-TIC_TAC_TOE-
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using C++. It is a simple, interactive console-based game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The game continues until one player wins or the grid is completely filled, resulting in a draw.

***Technologies Used***

✅ C++ – Core programming language for implementing logic.

✅ Standard I/O (cin, cout) – Console-based input and output handling.

✅ Basic Algorithms – Logic for checking win conditions and handling player moves.

✅ Looping & Conditional Statements – Used for turn-based play and decision-making.

****Purpose of the Project****

✔️ Strengthens C++ programming skills (arrays, loops, conditionals, functions).

✔️ Offers a fun and engaging way to learn programming concepts.


****Future Improvements & Enhancements****

🔹 Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like SFML or OpenGL.

🔹 Add an AI-based single-player mode where the computer can play against the user.

🔹 Improve the game’s UI by displaying a more structured board with better formatting.

🔹 Introduce a scoreboard to track wins and losses over multiple rounds.

🔹 Use file handling to save and load previous game results.
